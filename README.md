# Animations

Here you can find a record of my learning process in `C ++` using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) for creative coding.

Common setup:

```shell
projectGenerator -o "${folderDir}"
```

Or,

```shell
newAnimation
```

where

```shell
newAnimation() {
    today=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
    projectGenerator -o "$today"
}
```
